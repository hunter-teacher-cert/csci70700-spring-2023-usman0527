- The encryption code that I would create would be the tansposition cypher. To do this, my guess is that you would need to treat each letter in the message as a position in the array. This way you can create a double array and rearrange the letters into 2D array. From there you would need to extrapolate the words from the column positions of the array. I believe that this would be the way to create a transposition cypher.
